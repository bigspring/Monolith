	Monolith is a starter WordPress theme built with Twitter Bootstrap. We created this theme to use as our own starter theme,
	because most of the themes we were using either did too much or not enough for our needs.
	
	The aim is for Monolith to be constantly growing â€“ changing and developing as trends and web frameworks change, always giving us a good solid starting point from which to create our web projects.
	
	Monolith is released under the MIT Open Source license, so you're welcome to use it on any free or commercial projects of your own.
			
	Much love,
