	Monolith is a starter WordPress theme based on the fine work of
	Viewport Industries' Starkers theme
	(https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers) and the
	fine folk at Twitter Bootstrap.
	
	We created this theme to use as our own starter theme,
	because most of the themes we were using either did too much
	or not enough for our needs.
	
	* DANGER *
	
	It's very much still under development, so we wouldn't
	recommend you use this on any production site yet. We're
	serious.  Don't use this yet.  But feel free to contribute!
	
	Cheers
