	Monolith is a starter WordPress theme built with Twitter
	Bootstrap. We started this project as our own internal starter
	theme, because most of the other themes we were using either did
	too much or not enough for our needs.
	
	Alongside the Bootstrap grid goodness, Monolith comes bundled with
	a few useful functions and shortcodes that we've found useful enough
	to use on most projects. Anything that is too specific or heavy has
	been stripped out, and can be easily implemented on a project basis.
	
	The aim is for Monolith to be constantly growing â€“ changing
	and developing as trends and web frameworks change, always giving
	us a good solid starting point from which to create our web projects.
	
	Monolith is released under the MIT Open Source license, so you're
	welcome to use it on any free or commercial projects of your own.
			
	Much love,
	
	Team BigSpring
