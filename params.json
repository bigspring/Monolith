{"name":"Monolith","tagline":"a lightweight WordPress theme powered by Twitter Bootstrap, built for developers.","body":"Monolith is a starter WordPress theme built with Twitter Bootstrap. We started this project as our own internal starter\r\ntheme, because most of the other theme frameworks out there either did too much or not enough for our needs. So we built our own.\r\n\r\nAlongside the Bootstrap grid magic, monolith comes bundled with a few useful functions and shortcodes that we've found useful enough to use on most projects. Anything that is too project-specific or heavy has been stripped out, and can be easily implemented on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThe aim is for Monolith to be constantly growing â€“ changing and developing as trends and web frameworks change, always giving us a good solid starting point from which to create our web projects.\r\n\r\nMonolith is released under the MIT Open Source license, so you're welcome to use it on any free or commercial projects of your own.\r\n\r\nBe sure to read [the documentation](https://github.com/bigspring/monolith/wiki).\r\n\t\t\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nTeam BigSpring\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter:\r\n@bigspringweb, @juliotaylor, @simonBigSpring, @tulipdom\r\n\r\np.s. monolith is also available as part of [lunchbox](https://github.com/bigspring/lunchbox), a quickstart bash script that installs WordPress, monolith and an arsenal of handy plugins in a few seconds.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
