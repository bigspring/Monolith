about
-----

Monolith is a starter theme for WordPress. It's specifically designed to be a lightweight and lean as possible, to allow developers to create their own specialised themes with as little overhead as possible, using the power of Twitter Bootstrap and a few custom shortcodes and functions to help you along the way.

Anything that is too project-specific or heavy has been stripped out, and can be easily implemented on a case by case basis as needed.

We started this project as our own internal starter theme at BigSpring, because most of the other theme frameworks out there either did too much or not enough for our needs. So we built our own.

The aim is for Monolith to be constantly growing – changing and developing as trends and web frameworks change, always giving us a good solid starting point from which to create our web projects.

Monolith is released under the MIT Open Source license, so you're welcome to use it on any free or commercial projects of your own.

Be sure to read [the documentation](https://github.com/bigspring/monolith/wiki). Disclaimer: docs are a bit out of date but we're working on that!
		
Much love,
